I am working on a vibe-coding project to create a DOOM clone. This project will be fully browser-based, running only on the frontend. I want to provide the agent with an excellent technical foundation for this project. Please help me to sketch out the initial technical architecture for this project.

For a simple, retro-style 3D shooter like DOOM, what TypeScript libraries and tools should I use? There are two criteria I care for:

- I want an extremely simple setup. Minimize complexity! Fancy features like 3D graphics, savegames or multiplayer are not needed. Use only the minimum necessary to replicate the basics of classic DOOM.
- I want to minimize low-impact busywork. Avoid not-invented-here syndrome. Don't build things from scratch if they already exist. If there are relevant TypeScript libraries, use them instead of building from scratch.

What would you recommend? Feel free to keep your final recommendation down to a list of relevant technical choices by topic.
