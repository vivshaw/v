# Movement System Test Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Keyboard Input (WASD/Arrow Keys)
**Problem:** hotkeys-js library wasn't properly supporting continuous keydown/keyup states
**Solution:** Replaced with raw keyboard event handlers using event.code for reliable detection

### 2. Mouse Look
**Problem:** Mouse deltas were being replaced instead of accumulated, causing lost movements
**Solution:** Changed to accumulate deltas until processed in update loop

### 3. Render Loop
**Problem:** Frame limiting was causing jerky movement with inconsistent deltaTime
**Solution:** Removed frame limiting, now runs at full refresh rate

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001
2. Click anywhere to engage pointer lock
3. Test controls:
   - **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move forward/backward/strafe
   - **Mouse**: Look around
   - **Shift**: Run faster
   - **ESC**: Release pointer lock

## What Should Work Now

✅ WASD keys move the player in world space
✅ Arrow keys work as alternative movement controls  
✅ Mouse properly controls camera rotation
✅ Shift key increases movement speed
✅ Movement is smooth and responsive
✅ Diagonal movement is properly normalized
✅ ESC releases pointer lock

## Technical Details

- Input detection uses `KeyboardEvent.code` for layout-independent key detection
- Mouse deltas accumulate between frames to prevent lost input
- Movement speed: 320 units/sec walking, 448 units/sec running
- Mouse sensitivity: 0.002 radians per pixel
- Camera height: 41 units (DOOM eye level)
