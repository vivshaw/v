# analyze-chromatic-usage

this is a simple Jupyter notebook for number crunching on [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) usage reports. i used to do this a lot with hand-rolled spreadsheets. that was a pain, so i wrote a notebook for it.

while working at a scaling company, i found a number of unique challenges and surprises when trying to keep our costs down. what makes TurboSnap efficient or inefficient? s monthly usage growing due to more PRs, or less efficient runs? the peculiar selection of metrics and graphs here derived from those sorts of questions. your milage may vary! you may find you need to know different things than i do. if so, hopefully this can at least point you toward some things to think about.

## TODO

[ ] it would be nice if the repo-leve deep dive could exist _together_ with the account-level stats. like, switch over halfway down the notebook.
