# analyze-github-usage

this is a Jupyter notebook for simple data analysis of GitHub Enterprise usage reports. included is a CSV of dummy data, `summarizedUsageReport.dummy.csv`. you'll want to replace this with your real billing CSV. then you'll see:

- weekly cost trends
- a breakdown of your top spend by SKU, with weekly trends
- a breakdown of your top spend by repo, with weekly trends
- a pivot table and heatmap of how much each repos uses each SKU

if what you need is not one of those things, you can likely use the existing structure as a guide to build the thing you need.
