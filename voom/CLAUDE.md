This is a project to create an open-source DOOM clone. It will be built in TypeScript and run in the brower. No backend is necessary, only the frontend app. The graphics will be produced with only public domain images. Use `yarn` for package management. You will be asked to assume various different agent personas (PM, Designer, Developer, QA) over the course of this project, which you will find in @vibe/agents.

code style:

- use simple, idiomatic TypeScript
- don't overuse external dependencies
- avoid the use of `any` whenever possible

workflows:

- document anything important you learn that you'd like to refer to later in @vibe/NOTES.md
