# VOOM Project Brief

## Executive Summary

**Vision:** Create a faithful, browser-based recreation of DOOM's iconic E1M1 level using only royalty-free assets, demonstrating the viability of classic FPS gameplay in modern web technologies.

**Problem:** Classic DOOM requires downloads, installations, or proprietary assets to play. There's no simple, instant way to experience the foundational FPS gameplay that defined a genre.

**Target Users:** Retro gaming enthusiasts seeking nostalgic experiences and developers interested in open-source game development examples.

**Value Proposition:** Instant, browser-based access to classic DOOM gameplay without downloads, installations, or licensing concerns - fully open-source and built with modern web technologies.

## Problem Definition

### Problem Statement

The original DOOM (1993) remains a landmark achievement in gaming history, but accessing it today presents several barriers:

- **Asset Licensing:** Original DOOM assets are proprietary, limiting legal redistribution
- **Installation Friction:** Most DOOM experiences require downloads, source ports, or emulators
- **Platform Fragmentation:** Different devices require different solutions
- **Learning Barrier:** No simple, open-source reference implementation for developers wanting to understand classic FPS architecture

Players want immediate, frictionless access to experience or share this piece of gaming history. Developers need a clean, modern implementation to study foundational FPS mechanics.

## Solution Overview

### Solution Concept

VOOM delivers a browser-native recreation of DOOM's first level (E1M1: Hangar) using TypeScript and web technologies. The project prioritizes gameplay authenticity while using exclusively public domain assets, creating a legal, accessible, and educational implementation.

### Key Features
- Faithful recreation of E1M1 level geometry and layout
- Classic DOOM movement mechanics and controls
- Enemy AI matching original behavior patterns
- Weapon mechanics (pistol, shotgun, chaingun as found in E1M1)
- Health, armor, and ammunition systems
- Public domain sprites and textures maintaining the aesthetic

### Technical Approach
- **Frontend Only:** Pure client-side TypeScript application
- **Rendering:** Canvas-based 2.5D rendering engine
- **Architecture:** Component-based game engine with clear separation of concerns
- **Build System:** Yarn for dependency management, webpack for bundling
- **Performance Target:** 60 FPS on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Differentiation
This project explicitly avoids differentiation - success is measured by fidelity to the original experience within the constraints of royalty-free assets.

## Success Metrics & KPIs

### User KPIs
- **Load Time:** < 3 seconds to playable state on standard broadband
- **Performance:** Consistent 60 FPS on devices from 2020 onward
- **Input Latency:** < 16ms response time for player actions
- **Completion Rate:** 60% of players complete the level

### Technical KPIs
- **Code Coverage:** 80% test coverage for core systems
- **Bundle Size:** < 5MB initial download
- **Browser Support:** 95% of modern browser market share
- **Documentation:** 100% of public APIs documented

### Community KPIs
- **GitHub Stars:** 500 stars within 6 months
- **Contributors:** 10+ external contributors
- **Forks:** 50+ forks for learning/experimentation

## Scope Definition

### MVP Scope - Core Features (Must Have for Launch)

1. **E1M1 Level Geometry**
   - Accurate room layout and dimensions
   - Doors, switches, and elevators
   - Secret areas

2. **Player Mechanics**
   - Movement (WASD + mouse look)
   - Running and strafing
   - Collision detection

3. **Combat System**
   - Pistol implementation
   - Enemy spawns (Zombieman, Shotgun Guy, Imp)
   - Damage calculation and health system

4. **Core Pickups**
   - Ammunition
   - Health packs and armor
   - Keycards

5. **Victory Condition**
   - Level exit trigger
   - Basic completion screen

### Nice to Have (Post-MVP)
- Shotgun and chaingun weapons
- Sound effects (if royalty-free sources found)
- Basic menu system
- Performance optimizations
- Mobile touch controls

### Explicitly Out of Scope
- Multiplayer functionality
- Level editor
- Save/load system
- Additional levels beyond E1M1
- Original DOOM assets or textures
- Music/soundtrack
- Difficulty settings
- Advanced rendering effects (dynamic lighting, etc.)

### MVP Success Criteria
- Player can complete E1M1 from start to finish
- All core mechanics function without game-breaking bugs
- Runs at 60 FPS on target browsers
- Code is fully open-source under MIT license
- No proprietary assets included

## Constraints & Considerations

### Technical Constraints
- Browser sandbox limitations (no native code execution)
- WebGL/Canvas API performance boundaries
- JavaScript single-threaded execution model
- Cross-browser compatibility requirements
- No backend infrastructure

### Resource Constraints
- Zero budget - purely volunteer effort
- Limited availability of quality public domain assets
- No dedicated QA resources
- Community-driven development pace

### External Dependencies
- **Critical:** Availability of public domain sprite assets
- **Important:** Browser API stability and performance
- **Risk:** Asset quality may impact visual fidelity
- **Risk:** Community interest and contribution levels

### Legal Considerations
- Strict adherence to public domain or MIT-compatible licenses
- No use of DOOM trademarks or branding
- Clear attribution for all asset sources
- Explicit disclaimer about relationship to id Software/Bethesda
